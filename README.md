Interval linear algebra. When your matrices contain intervals.

## Status

Currently, very much a work in progress! Pre-alpha, even! User beware!

So far, the basic functionality of arithmetic operations is implemented. Gaussian elimination and back substitution for solving linear systems are implemented. I am working on implementing the properties of interval matrices. And then after that, other methods for solving linear systems like Gauss-Seidel, etc.

## Roadmap
- Gauss-Seidel method
- Matrix inverse
- Obtaining an initial enclosure for iterative linear system solvers
- Eigenvalue/eigenvectors
- Determinant
