Interval linear algebra. When your matrices contain intervals.

## Status

Currently, very much a work in progress! Pre-alpha, even! User beware!

So far, the basic functionality of arithmetic operations is implemented.
Gaussian elimination and back substitution for solving linear systems are implemented, though I am still working out a bug (which I think is due to numerical instability).

## Roadmap
- Gauss-Seidel method
- Matrix inverse
- Obtaining an initial enclosure for iterative linear system solvers
- Eigenvalue/eigenvectors
- Determinant
