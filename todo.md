- tests for constructors and arithmetic operations
- linalg
    - inv
    - gauss_seidel
    - initial enclosure
    - go through the horacek thesis basically
- implement eigenvalue and eigenvector functions and determinant


ROADMAP:
- make sure all core functionality is solid, tested, etc.
- implement linear system solvers like gauss-seidel, etc.
- implement eigenvalue and eigenvector functions
